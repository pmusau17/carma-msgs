# Returns the transform between the two provided frame ids. If the transform is not defined returns an error status flag
# Returned transform defines the location of the child frame relative to the parent frame

# The parent frame which if transformed by the returned value would be located at the child frame
string parent_frame
# The child frame of the transform
string child_frame
# The timestamp which the returned transform should correspond to
# A time of 0 such as ros::Time(0) can be used to get the most recent transform
